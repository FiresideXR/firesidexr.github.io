FiresideXR is a social XR platform designed to be comfortable for all, and to last forever.
We put human interaction first, with a focus on events and social hubs.
FiresideXR has decentralized aspects that allow it to persist in the event of total server shutdown.
<br>
("decentralized aspects" do not include cryptocurrencies)


<br><br>

FiresideXR is built by 
<a href="https://dungenrobot.com" class="link-dungen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anders Olsen</a> 
and 
<a href="https://www.cooperludt.com/" class="link-coast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cooper Ludt</a>.
Anders and Cooper met on a now defunct social VR platform in late 2018.
Anders is pursing studies in computer science, 
while Cooper explores graphic design, 3d modeling, and many other forms of digital art.
Both are studying game design.

<br><br>

Neither of them felt satisfied with the VR platforms they tried.
In 2024, they teamed up to create their perfect social platform.
Combining every aspect of social XR that they loved, and building it on a protocol that could outlive them.

<br><br>

We don't want to create a billion dollar startup, we want to make a new home for us and our friends. 
<br><br>
We hope you'll join us.
