<p>
    We can't do any of this without funding.
    In an ideal world we'll be able to rely on subscriptions from those users that choose to support us or need more robust creator tools or event support.
    If that ends up being unsustainable, we'd seek coporate sponsorship or alternative revanue sources like paid cosmetics.
    We will never include predatory monetization models, including premium currencies, loot crates, and FOMO tactics like battle passes.
    <br>
    Any monetization should be <b>based on your support, not your exploitation.</b>
</p>
<p>
    If you love our mission and want to support us, we'll be making subscriptions available soon.
